<h2>
    Bundling JavaScript Code
</h2>

<h3>Used Tools</h3>
<p>
    We use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">YARN</a>
    to download the library
    <a href="https://lodash.com/">loadash</a>.
    This is a very popular library providing several utility functions.
    Here, we just use some of them related to arrays.
    When YARN is run on a project, it will read the content of the
    'package.json' configuration file.
</p>

<p>
    Because <em>loadash</em> is a library, it needs to be imported in this HTML file besides
    our own JavaScript code.
    We use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">WebPack</a> to bundle all the JS code
    together into a single <em>bundle.js</em> file.
    This can also improve performance, as the browser needs to do only a single HTTP GET
    call to get all the needed JS.
    <em>WebPack</em> is configured in a file called <em>webpack.config.js</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Note that, to properly use <em>WebPack</em>, we need to do some manual changes into the
    <em>package.json</em> configuration file of YARN.
    You could expect some comments directly in the <em>package.json</em> to describe what needs
    to be changed.
    Unfortunately, this is not possible, because the JSON format does not support comments!!!
    You might wonder why JSON was chosen as configuration format instead of more sane
    options like YAML or XML (in this context XML is better than JSON)...
    Yes, that is a big limitation of YARN/NPM (and its developers have no intention to fix it).
    Note: there are some
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14221579/how-do-i-add-comments-to-package-json-for-npm-install">
        workarounds
    </a>
    to somehow simulate comments in JSON, but those are really awful, dirty hacks.
</p>


<h3>Example With Loadash</h3>

<p>
    Array value: <span id="arrayStringId"></span>
</p>
<ui>
    <li>_.min(): <span id="minId"></span></li>
    <li>_.max(): <span id="maxId"></span></li>
    <li>_.mean(): <span id="meanId"></span></li>
    <li>_.sum(): <span id="sumId"></span></li>
</ui>


<h3>Executed Commands</h3>

<div>
    <p>
        To create a new project, we use <em>yarn init</em>, which will create
        files like <em>package.json</em>.
        This can be seen like a <em>pom.xml</em> file in Maven/Java.
        Libraries need to be installed with <em>yarn install</em>.
        Here we need both <em>WebPack</em> and <em>loadash</em>.
        When a library is "installed", it will be downloaded under
        the <em>node_modules</em> folder (and also cached on your home folder).
        Note: it is very important to do NOT add such folder on Git.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Loadash</em> will be part of our final code, whereas  <em>WebPack</em>
        is just a tool/plugin to build the project.
        See the differences between <em>dependencies</em> and <em>devDependencies</em>
        in the <em>package.json</em> file.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you work on an existing project, where the <em>package.json</em>
        and <em>yarn.lock</em> are already there in the Git repository,
        you just need to run <em>npm install</em> to download all the libraries
        defined in <em>package.json</em> into <em>node_modules</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, to build the <em>bundle.js</em> file and start a server, we run <em>yarn dev</em>.
        The <em>yarn</em> does execute one of the commands defined in the
        <em>scripts</em> section of the <em>package.json</em> file.
        We need to manually modify it to enable  <em>WebPack</em>.
        Note the 2 different versions: <em>dev</em> to use during development/debugging
        (which also starts a server with hot-reload),
        and <em>build</em> for the final version for production.
        This latter does a few optimizations, which unfortunately
        make the generated JavaScript hard to read.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we run <em>yarn dev</em>, not only we generate the <em>bundle.js</em> file
        in a more human-friendly format,
        but also start a HTTP server for it, with the browser opening at that page.
        Furthermore, <em>WebPack</em> will look at the changes in <em>./src</em>,
        and rebuild automatically every time we do changes.
        However, we still need to do a refresh in the browser to see the updates.
