<h2>
    Dynamic Updates Based on Input Typing
</h2>

<p>
    In this page, we enable the user to directly type a list of numeric
    values separated by "," commas.
    For example: 1, 3, -2.
    Every time the array is changed, statistics like mean and max are recomputed.
</p>

<p>
    Numeric values (separated by "," commas): <input id="inputId"/>
</p>

<ui>
    <li>Min value: <span id="minId"></span></li>
    <li>Max value: <span id="maxId"></span></li>
    <li>Mean value: <span id="meanId"></span></li>
    <li>Sum value: <span id="sumId"></span></li>
</ui>


<h2>
    Writing Unit Tests
</h2>

<p>
    We have a page that displays some information, and has some client-side updates based
    on some business logic.
    We want to make sure that such business logic is correct.
    However, we do not want to rebuild the whole JS and fire up a browser each time we
    do a modification to check if correct.
    To address this problem, we will use <em>unit tests</em>.
</p>

<p>
    A unit test will execute the function we want to check, and see if its output
    does match the expected one.
    If there is a mismatch, then the test will fail, and we know there is a bug.
    Test cases are also very useful for <em>regression testing</em>: when you do modifications
    in your code, you do not want to break any existing functionality.
    So, before pushing your changes on Git, you could re-run all the tests to check if
    any regression bug was introduced.
</p>

<p>
    To run tests in JS, we use the popular library
    <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>.
    The test will be executed by YARN (this needs to be configured in the <em>package.json</em> file).
    There is one problem though: to run the tests, we need an environment that can execute JS code.
    To do that, NodeJS (which is used for server-side JS) is automatically setup.
    However, there are some differences between client-side (what we have done so far) and
    server-side JS.
    For example, the handling of JS modules is different.
    In client-side JS, we use keywords like <em>import</em> and <em>export</em> which
    would not be recognized in NodeJS.
    To overcome this problem, we need to automatically modify our JS code before it is run
    from the unit tests.
    To do this, we use
    <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, and tell Jest to apply it before running the
    tests (this is done with the <em>babel-jest</em> library).
    See its configuration file called <em>.babelrc</em>.
    Also look at <em>scripts</em> and <em>jest</em> configurations in <em>package.json</em> file.
