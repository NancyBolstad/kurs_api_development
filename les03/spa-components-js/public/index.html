<h2>Important To Know</h2>

<p>
    Here we introduce the concept of <em>components</em>.
    A component is a JavaScript unit which is responsible to
    draw HTML, and keep an internal state, with actions registered
    for on the HTML tags.
    When the state of the a component does change, then it should
    <em>automatically</em> re-render itself, greatly simplifying the coding.
</p>

<p>
    A component can be instantiated more than once.
    A component can have other components inside.
    For example, here we have an "App" that contains 3 "Counter"
    components.
    A Counter keeps track of a numerical value, with buttons to increase
    and decrease it by 1.
</p>

<p>
    When dealing with components, we want to do it efficiently.
    A change in a single displayed value should not trigger the re-rendering
    of an entire HTML page.
    To do that, we use existing libraries/frameworks.
    One of the most popular is <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>,
    made by Facebook.
    However, before digging into it, here we show how this could be (very inefficiently)
    achieved by just using vanilla JavaScript.
