<h2>Find The Joker</h2>

<p>
    In this game, you need to find the Joker among the 3 covered cards.
    Once you make your choice, the game will uncover 1 of the other 2 cards
    that is not the Joker.
    You will then be asked if you want to stick with your original choice, or
    if your rather prefer to choose the other uncovered card.
</p>

<p>
    What is the best strategy to play this game?
    Always stick to your first choice?
    Always change choice?
    Change at random?
    Regardless of your strategy, can you prove it is optimal?

        You can change your choice if you want.

        Just re-click on a covered card to find the Joker.

    Solution

    The best strategy is to ALWAYS change choice.
    When you first choose, you have a 1/3, i.e. 33%, probability of getting the Joker.
    This will not change based on what the game decides to uncover.
    However, if you change card, you will always win if your original choice
    was NOT a Joker, as only 2 cards are left (and if the current is not a
    Joker, then the other must be).
    The probability of not getting the Joker at first choice is 2/3, i.e. 66%.
    In other words, always choosing to switch card does DOUBLE your odds of success!!!
