<h2>
    Just a Basic Home Page
</h2>

<p>
    In WebStorm, you can open this page directly by right-click on the file and
    choose "Open in Browser".
    This will start a web server for the folder of this file, which will be served
    over HTTP on an ephemeral port.
</p>

<p>
    Question(s): what is an ephemeral port, and why is it used here instead of port 80?
</p>

<p>
    Another option to see this page is to open it directly from the file system.
    The page will be visualized, but the protocol would be "file" instead of "http".
    You can check it in the URL address bar.
    However, it is preferred to serve HTML files from a server, as that is the actual
    usage in practice.

<p>
    Example of linking, going to another <a href="other.html">Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    When clicking on a &lt;a&gt; link, the browser will make a request for the new page
    (e.g., using HTTP) based on the href attribute.
    If it is not a full URL, it will be resolved against the server and relative path
    from which this page was loaded from.
    Also notice the use of &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; in the HTML code to escape the text
    "&lt;a&gt;", which otherwise would be handled as a link tag.
    Also notice the escaping of the escaping to be able to display &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;.
